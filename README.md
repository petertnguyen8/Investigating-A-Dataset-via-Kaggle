# Investigating a Kaggle Dataset with Python

## üìñ About the Project

This project showcases a data investigation of a Kaggle dataset using Python, primarily within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The analysis leverages the power of Python's data science libraries, **NumPy** and **pandas**, to clean, manipulate, analyze, and visualize the data, ultimately drawing meaningful conclusions and communicating findings.

This project is part of a learning exercise to demonstrate proficiency in data analysis and storytelling.
